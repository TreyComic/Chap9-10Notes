public class Duck2{
int size;
public Duck2 (){
    //supply default duckSize !!!
    size = 27;
}
}


public Duck2 (int duckSize){
    // use duckSize parameter !!!
    size = duckSize;
}

when making a new duck object we can set our value in the args
Duck2 d = new Duck2(15);

You can have more than 1 constructor in a class based on variable type

public Duck(){}
public Duck(int size){}
public Duck(String name){}
public Duck(String name, int size){}

Hippo.weight();
weight is our method within hippo in theory

Class Player{
    static int PlayerCount = 0;
    private String name;
    public Player(String n){
        name = n;
        playerCount ++; 
    }
}

Class Player{
    static int PlayerCount = 0; //our newly set and locked number based on iteration
    private String name; //set our name
    public Player(String n){ //taking in our name based on object args
        name = n; //set args to set name to make new name updated
        playerCount ++; //adds a player count each creation of an object
    }
}
